## Installation

### Using Homebrew

Install VPN Bar via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap borzov/vpn-bar https://github.com/borzov/vpn-bar
brew install --cask vpn-bar
```

By default, Homebrew installs apps to `~/Applications`. To install to `/Applications` instead:

```bash
brew install --cask --appdir="/Applications" vpn-bar
```

To update:
```bash
brew upgrade --cask vpn-bar
```

**Note:** The Cask applies `xattr -cr` automatically after installation, so extra steps are usually not needed for first launch. **Homebrew is the recommended installation method** to avoid manual quarantine removal.

If the app is still blocked or shows "damaged" after `brew install --cask vpn-bar`, run `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/VPNBarApp.app` (or `~/Applications/VPNBarApp.app`) and, if macOS shows a security message, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/borzov/vpn-bar/releases)
2. Extract the `VPNBarApp.zip` archive
3. Drag `VPNBarApp.app` to your Applications folder
4. Launch the application from Applications

**Note:** The technical name remains `VPNBarApp.app`, but it displays as "VPN Bar" in the system.

**Note:** On first launch, macOS may request permission to access the network extension. Allow access for the app to work correctly.

**Note:** If macOS shows a security warning, open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** next to the message about the app.

### App doesn't start or no process appears

If the app does not start and no process appears in Activity Monitor, try the following.

#### Installation via Homebrew (recommended)

The Cask applies `xattr -cr` after installation. If the app still does not start:

- Check for quarantine: `xattr -l /Applications/VPNBarApp.app` (or `~/Applications/VPNBarApp.app`). If `com.apple.quarantine` is present, run: `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/VPNBarApp.app`
- Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and, if there is a message about a blocked app, click **Open Anyway**

#### Manual installation from ZIP

Before the **first** launch, run:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/VPNBarApp.app
```

If macOS still blocks the app, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

#### Running from Terminal for diagnosis

If the process still does not appear:

```bash
/Applications/VPNBarApp.app/Contents/MacOS/VPNBarApp
```

Watch stderr. Alternatively: `open /Applications/VPNBarApp.app` and, if it crashes, check **Console.app** or run:

```bash
log show --predicate 'processImagePath contains "VPNBar"' --last 5m
```

#### Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later on **Apple Silicon** (arm64). Releases are not universal.

#### App runs but nothing is visible

This app is **menu bar only**: there is no window and no Dock icon. Look for the icon on the **right side of the menu bar** (near the clock, Wi‑Fi, battery).

## Usage

### Basic Actions

- **Left-click the icon** — toggles the active VPN connection (or the first available if none are active)
- **Right-click the icon** — opens the menu with VPN connections list
- **Click a VPN in the menu** — connects or disconnects the selected VPN
- **Hotkey** — configurable keyboard shortcut to toggle VPN from any application

### Settings

Open the menu and select "Settings" to access app preferences:

#### General
- **Status Update Interval** — configure how often the app checks VPN connection status (recommended: 10-15 seconds)
- **Notifications** — enable/disable system notifications when VPN connects or disconnects
- **Display** — show connection name in tooltip when hovering over the icon
- **Launch at Login** — automatically start the app at system login (macOS 13+)

#### Hotkeys
- **Toggle VPN** — set a global hotkey for quick VPN toggling
- Enhanced shortcut recording interface with visual modifier display and validation

#### About
- App information, version, and author
- Brief functionality description
- Direct link to the GitHub repository

## System Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later (Apple Silicon)
- Configured VPN connections in the system

## Auto-Start

To automatically launch the app at login:

1. Open **System Settings**
2. Go to **Users & Groups**
3. Select the **Login Items** tab
4. Click the **+** button and add `VPNBarApp.app` (displays as "VPN Bar")

## Development

The application is built with Swift and follows Apple's guidelines for native macOS app development.

### Building from Source

```bash
swift build -c release
./Scripts/package_app.sh
```

### Creating a Release

Releases are created automatically when pushing a tag in the `v*` format (e.g., `v0.6.0`):

```bash
# After finishing work on a version
git tag v0.6.0
git push origin v0.6.0
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Build the application
- Create the .app bundle
- Package it into a ZIP archive
- Create a GitHub Release with the attached archive
